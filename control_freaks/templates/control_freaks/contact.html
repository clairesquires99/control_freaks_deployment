      <h3>Katie Moore</h3>
      <h5>Illustrator</h5>
      <p>Crazy cat lady, newspaper illustrator and Art History 
        and Spanish student at the University of Edinburgh. 
        From the Emerald Isle, I boast an insatiable hunger 
        for excruciatingly punful jokes, breakfast for dinner 
        and potatoes whether they be gratined, boiled, baked, 
        pan-fried, deep-fried, mashed, air-fried, or grated. 
        After I graduate I would like to travel and teach 
        languages, and continue taking various art courses on 
        the side. I hope this website will be a place for you a 
        share your frustration as well as find comfort in knowing 
        you are not alone.</p>

      <p>I'm a fourth year Linguistics and Social Anthropology 
        student at the University of Edinburgh, looking to 
        improve our experiences of contraception. Currently, 
        I'm doing my dissertation in social anthropology on 
        contraceptive experiences in the UK, and plan on 
        continuing similar research at postgrad level. In my 
        spare time, I enjoy painting, chatting shit, and thinking 
        about questions like, 'How do fish survive without eyelids?'. 
        I'm really looking forward to hearing all of your stories 
        and feedback :)</p>

      <h3>Claire Squires</h3>
      <h5>Web-developer</h5>
      <p>Chocolate for breakfast kind of person in my last year 
        of a BSc in Cognitive Science at the University of 
        Edinburgh, aiming to go into software engineering 
        when I graduate. A friend once pointed out that coding 
        is one of the few things where you can make something 
        from nothing. This space is proof of that. Where once 
        voices and stories were scattered, I hope now they may 
        have a home here â€“ where they are heard and shared.</p>
